# Cloud Resume Project - AWS
This is my repository for the cloud resume project by Forrest Brazeal: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/ 

I host my website on AWS using:
* S3 Static Website
* Amazon CloudFront
* Amazon Route 53
* Amazon DynamoDB
* AWS Lambda
* Boto3
* GitHub Actions

## Step 1: AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner
The first step in the challenge is to pass the [AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) exam. 
It took me around 2 weeks to study and prepare for the exam

For study material I used:
* AWS's free [cloud practicioner essentials course](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/134/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials)
* [Practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-test/) from Mohamed Ali on Udemy

## Step 2: HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## Step 3: Creating an S3 Static Website on AWS
